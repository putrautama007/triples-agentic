# triples-agentic

A platform-agnostic software engineering agent orchestrator, named after the 24-member K-pop group **TripleS**.

14 specialized agents covering project setup plus the full product-to-delivery lifecycle — from PRD to UI/UX design, RFC, task breakdown, implementation across 5 platforms, automated code quality checks, test cases, and QA.

SeoYeon is the only agent that stays a Skill (`/seoyeon` on Claude Code, `$seoyeon` on Codex) — she's the pipeline entry point. The other 13 install as native, model-pinned **subagents**: `.claude/agents/*.md` on Claude Code, `.codex/agents/*.toml` on Codex (see [Files installed per platform](#files-installed-per-platform)).

## Workflow

```
User → SeoYeon (EM)
         → JiWoo (PRD) [human review loop]
         → HyeRin (UI/UX Design) [human review loop]   ┐ Lynn (Test Cases) runs
         → YooYeon (RFC) [human review loop]            │ as a PRD-driven parallel
         → NaKyoung (Tasks) [human review loop]         ┘ track from PRD approval
         → YuBin + Kaede + YeonJi + SoHyun + Kotone [parallel dev]
         → DaHyun (Check: tests/types/lint) [auto-loop on failure]
         → ShiOn (QA) → Go/No-Go   (needs dev complete + Test Cases approved)
```

## Installation

### Install via curl (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/putrautama007/triples-agentic/main/install.sh | bash
```

Checks Node.js ≥ 18, then launches the interactive wizard.

Pass a platform directly to skip the wizard:

```bash
# Claude Code — project-level
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/putrautama007/triples-agentic/main/install.sh | bash -s -- claude

# Claude Code — global (all projects on your machine)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/putrautama007/triples-agentic/main/install.sh | bash -s -- claude --global

# Cursor AI — global
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/putrautama007/triples-agentic/main/install.sh | bash -s -- cursor --global

# All platforms at once
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/putrautama007/triples-agentic/main/install.sh | bash -s -- all

# Update all existing installations (auto-detects platforms and scope)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/putrautama007/triples-agentic/main/install.sh | bash -s -- update
```

### Files installed per platform

| Platform | Specialist agents | Orchestrator + knowledge | Hook config |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `.claude/agents/*.md` (13 model-pinned subagents) | `.claude/skills/seoyeon/` + `.claude/skills/*` + project `CLAUDE.md` | `.claude/settings.json` (PreToolUse hook) |
| **Cursor AI** | — (all agents are rules) | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | `.cursor/rules/triples-safety.mdc` (always-applied rule) |
| **GitHub Copilot** | — (all agents are instructions) | `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` | `.github/instructions/triples-safety.instructions.md` |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `.codex/agents/*.toml` (13 model-pinned subagents) | `.codex/skills/seoyeon/` + `.codex/skills/*` + project `AGENTS.md` | `.codex/config.toml` (PreToolUse hook) |
| **Windsurf** | — (all agents are rules) | `.windsurfrules` | `.windsurf/hooks.json` (pre_run_command hook) |

Subagents are explicit-invocation only (Agent tool on Claude Code, "spawn the `<name>` agent" on Codex) — SeoYeon delegates to them automatically during `/seoyeon run` / `$seoyeon`, or you can invoke one directly. See the [Agent Roster](#agent-roster) for the model pinned to each.

Global install paths:

| Platform | Agents | Skills | Hook config |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/agents/` | `~/.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/settings.json` |
| Cursor AI | — | `~/.cursor/rules/` | `~/.cursor/rules/triples-safety.mdc` |
| OpenAI Codex | `~/.codex/agents/` | `~/.codex/skills/` | `~/.codex/config.toml` |
| Windsurf | — | `~/.codeium/windsurf/rules/` | `~/.codeium/windsurf/hooks.json` |

---

## Safety Guardrails

Every install includes safety enforcement that blocks dangerous shell commands before they run.

### How it works per platform

| Platform | Mechanism | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `PreToolUse` hook in `.claude/settings.json` | Hard — harness blocks the command |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `PreToolUse` hook in `.codex/config.toml` | Hard — same engine as Claude Code |
| **Windsurf** | `pre_run_command` hook in `.windsurf/hooks.json` | Hard — exit code 2 blocks execution |
| **Cursor AI** | `alwaysApply: true` rule in `.cursor/rules/` | Soft — AI-level instruction |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `applyTo: "**"` instruction in `.github/instructions/` | Soft — AI-level instruction |

### Blocked commands

- **Filesystem** — `rm -rf`, `rm -fr`, recursive force delete
- **Git destructive** — `git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`, `git restore .`
- **Git push force** — `git push --force`, `git push -f`
- **SQL destructive** — `DROP TABLE`, `DROP DATABASE`, `DELETE FROM <table>;`
- **Store publish** — `fastlane deliver/supply`, `gradlew publishBundle`, `xcrun altool`
- **Package publish** — `npm publish`, `npx ... publish`

Safe commands (`npm test`, `git push origin branch`, `flutter test`, etc.) pass through without interruption.

### Adding or editing safety rules

All hook definitions live in [`src/hooks/`](src/hooks/):

- `dangerous-commands.json` — per-platform hook configs (Claude Code, Codex, Windsurf)
- `dangerous-commands.md` — text-based safety rules (Cursor, Copilot)

Edit these files and reinstall to update the rules across all platforms.

## Usage

### Full pipeline (Claude Code)
```
/seoyeon run                Full pipeline from PRD
/seoyeon run --from rfc      Start at RFC (attach/place PRD + Design first)
/seoyeon run --from dev      Start at Development (attach/place Tasks + Design first)
/seoyeon status             Check current run state
/seoyeon resume             Continue after a token-limit reset or closed session
```
SeoYeon walks you through the complete workflow and delegates to each agent.

Already have an upstream artifact? Start mid-pipeline with `/seoyeon run --from design|rfc|tasks|dev` and attach (or pre-place in `workspace/`) the documents that stage depends on — skipped stages are recorded as provided, and every downstream human-approval gate still fires. If a stage agent finds the supplied context unclear, it asks you numbered open questions and, when an answer invalidates an upstream doc, spawns that doc's owning agent to revise it.

Long runs are resumable. SeoYeon keeps a ledger at `workspace/RUN_STATE.md` and every agent flushes it after each completed unit of work, so if you hit a usage limit mid-pipeline, `/seoyeon resume` picks up from the last in-flight task — not the start of the stage.

### Specialist subagents (Claude Code Agent tool)
SeoYeon delegates to these automatically during `/seoyeon run`, or invoke one directly:

```
chaewon-init-setup [sonnet]  Explain or audit local TripleS setup
jiwoo-prd          [opus]    Create, review, and finalize a PRD
hyerin-design      [opus]    Create, review, and finalize a design spec
yooyeon-rfc        [opus]    Create, review, and finalize an RFC
nakyoung-tasks     [opus]    Create task breakdown with story points and estimates
yubin-frontend     [sonnet]  Implement frontend web features
kaede-backend      [sonnet]  Implement backend API and services
yeonji-android     [sonnet]  Implement Android (Kotlin + Compose) features
sohyun-ios         [sonnet]  Implement iOS (Swift + SwiftUI) features
kotone-flutter     [sonnet]  Implement Flutter (Dart) cross-platform features
lynn-testcase      [opus]    Create, review, and finalize test cases
dahyun-checker     [sonnet]  Run tests, type checks, and lint; report failures by platform
shion-qa           [sonnet]  Execute tests and produce Go/No-Go report
```

### In Codex
Use `$seoyeon` to orchestrate the full pipeline, or `/skills` to browse the orchestrator skill and bundled knowledge references. Specialist agents are Codex custom subagents — they're explicit-invocation only, so name the agent in your request:

```text
$seoyeon to orchestrate this feature from PRD through QA with human review gates and a QA rework loop.
Ask Codex to spawn the jiwoo-prd agent to draft the PRD for this feature.
Ask Codex to spawn the kaede-backend agent to implement the backend task from the breakdown.
Ask Codex to spawn the chaewon-init-setup agent to explain or audit the local TripleS setup.
```

Codex specialists inherit the parent task's available tools. TripleS does not
emit a custom-agent tool array because that is not part of the supported Codex
agent schema. Human decisions are returned to SeoYeon or the invoking parent as
`TRIPLES_USER_INPUT_REQUIRED`; the parent presents the question and re-invokes
the specialist with the correlated answer.

### Claude + Codex continuity

SeoYeon handoffs include both platform forms so you can continue the same run in either assistant:

```text
Next agent: JiWoo PRD
Claude: invoke the `jiwoo-prd` subagent (Agent tool)
Codex: ask Codex to spawn the `jiwoo-prd` agent
Input artifacts: workspace/PRD.md
Task: Review and revise until READY.
Open decisions: none
```

Artifacts in `workspace/` are the source of truth, not chat memory.

### With other coding assistants
Ask for the agent by name — e.g., "Act as JiWoo and create a PRD for [description]"

---

## Human-in-the-Loop Gates

JiWoo, HyeRin, YooYeon, NaKyoung, and Lynn all have built-in review loops:

1. Agent creates artifact
2. Agent reviews against quality gate checklist
3. Agent evaluates: `READY` or `GAPS: [list]`
4. On gaps: the agent produces up to three specific questions
5. Claude may present them directly with `AskUserQuestion`; on Codex the specialist returns them to SeoYeon/the parent
6. On Codex, the parent persists the request, presents it, and re-invokes the specialist with the correlated answers
7. Agent updates and loops → repeat until `READY`

This ensures PRD, design spec, RFC, task breakdown, and test cases are implementation-ready before moving forward.

On Codex, `request_user_input` is used only when that native tool is callable
and the supplied options are compatible. Otherwise the parent asks the same
questions in plain text. A pending or partially answered request never advances
the pipeline.

### Codex troubleshooting

After upgrading an existing Codex installation, refresh the generated files and
start a new task so Codex reloads its custom-agent definitions:

```bash
npx triples-agentic update
codex doctor --json
```

The doctor's `config.load` check should not contain a startup warning naming a
TripleS agent as malformed. If it does, confirm the affected `.codex/agents/*.toml`
file does not contain a top-level `tools = [...]` array, rerun the update, and
restart Codex.

## Code Quality Check Loop

After all developer agents finish and test cases are approved, SeoYeon delegates to DaHyun (`dahyun-checker`), who runs tests, type checks, and lint per platform and writes `workspace/CHECK_REPORT.md`. On `CHECK FAILED`, SeoYeon routes the failures (grouped by platform ownership) back to the owning developer agent, then re-invokes DaHyun. ShiOn (QA) only starts once DaHyun signals `CHECK PASSED`.

Escalation happens if the loop runs more than 5 times without a clean check.

## QA Rework Loop

If ShiOn returns `QA COMPLETE — NO-GO`, SeoYeon routes defects back to the owning developer agents, then asks ShiOn to re-test fixes and regression-risk areas. The loop repeats until `QA COMPLETE — GO` or the human explicitly accepts documented release risk.

Escalation happens when the same QA defect survives 2 fix attempts, the same planning gate fails 3 times, or a fix requires changing approved scope, design behavior, or architecture.

### `agents/` — Behavioral definitions

Each agent file defines: identity, persona, knowledge references, tool guardrails, skills (workflows), and handoff signals. Domain content lives in `skills/` — agents only reference it.

Each agent includes a `## Tools` section that specifies which tools to use and which to avoid (e.g., planning agents never use `Bash`; QA agent never edits source files).

Two metadata comments control per-agent model pinning at install time: `<!-- model: opus|sonnet -->` (read by the Claude Code installer) and `<!-- codex-model: gpt-5.5|gpt-5.3-codex -->` (read by the Codex installer). `seoyeon.md` has neither — she installs as a Skill, not a subagent, on both platforms.

### `hooks/` — Safety guardrails (source of truth)

Hook definitions live in `src/hooks/` as platform-agnostic source files. The installer reads them and generates the appropriate config for each platform:

- **`.json` files** carry per-platform hook configs under a `platforms` key (`claude`, `codex`, `windsurf`)
- **`.md` files** carry text-based safety rules for platforms without executable hooks (`cursor`, `copilot`)

### `skills/` — Domain expertise

Pure reference `.md` files — no trigger logic, no skills framework. Agents declare which files to load via `<!-- knowledge: ... -->` metadata in their agent file. The knowledge files travel with the agents during install.

## Inspired by

[TripleS](https://triples.fandom.com/wiki/TripleS) — a 24-member multi-national K-pop group under MODHAUS, operating on a decentralized system where members rotate between subunits based on fan participation.

Just like TripleS subunits activate for specific projects, TripleS agents activate for specific phases of software delivery.
